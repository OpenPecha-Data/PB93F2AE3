An Aspiration Prayer
revealed by Dudjom Lingpa

Everyone should always devote themselves to the following aspiration:
könchok rinchen sum gyi den tob kyi
By the force of the truth of the precious Three Jewels,
tserab kyewé trengwa tamché du
Throughout the succession of all my lives to come,
dak ni gangdu nepé sachok der
In whatever place that I may reside,
sangye tenpa dar shying gyepar shok
May the teachings of the Buddha flourish and spread!
semchen tamché dé shying kyipar shok
May all sentient beings enjoy happiness and fulfillment!
taktu dampé chö la chöpar shok
May they always engage in the practice of the holy Dharma!
dön nyi lhündrub ku nyi ngöngyur shok
May the two aims be spontaneously fulfilled and may we realize the two kāyas!
lalo dü kyi tenpa nubpar shok
May the teachings of the barbaric māras disappear!
orgyen chenpö trinlé palbar né
Through the blazing splendor of the Great Orgyen's activity,
shedrub tenpa chok tar gyepar shok
May the study and practice of Dharma spread far and wide!

When Vajrapāṇi, Lord of Secrets, said: “All who wish to act according to the Dharma should recite
and treasure this aspiration!”, I, Dudjom Dorje, wrote down these words.
