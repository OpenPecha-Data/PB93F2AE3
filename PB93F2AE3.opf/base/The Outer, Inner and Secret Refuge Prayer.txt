The Outer, Inner and Secret Refuge Prayer
by Dudjom Lingpa

könchok sum dang tsa sum ku sum lha
The Three Jewels, Three Roots and divine Three Kāyas,
ngowo rangshyin tukjé daknyi pal
And essence, nature and capacity—their glorious embodiment
lumé ten gyi gönpo lama la
Is my guru, the unfailing and everlasting protector.
kyab su chi o jesu zung du sol
In you I take refuge: hold me in your care, I pray!
sarva guru ratna siddhi hung
sarva guru ratna siddhi hūṃ

At the request of Özer, this was written by Dudjom. May it be virtuous!
