A Prayer to Dudjom Lingpa
by Dudjom Lingpa

orgyen gyaltsab drodul trulpé ku
You are the regent of Orgyen, an emanated tamer of beings,
shyir né chöku ngöngyur rigpé khar
Who actualized the dharmakāya that is present as the ground
khordé dak nyam rolpé ding chen tob
And, within the space of awareness, gained vast assurance that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are the display
of purity and equalness —
düjom dorjé shyab la solwa deb
Dudjom Dorje, at your feet I pray!

At the request of my own noble student, Dorje Nampar Gyalwa, this was composed by Dudjom Dorje.
May it be virtuous!
