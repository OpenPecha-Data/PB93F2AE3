A Prayer
by Dudjom Lingpa

emaho
Emaho!
khyabdak dömé gönpo kuntuzang
Pervasive lord and primordial protector, Samantabhadra,
dechen longchö dzok ku nang tayé
Sambhogakāya of great bliss, Amitābha,
tukjé drodul palden pema kyé
Compassionate tamer of beings, glorious Padmākara,
namkhé naljor düjom drakpo tsal
And the sky-like yogin, Dudjom Drakpa Tsal—
solwa deb so dak gyü jingyi lob
To all of you I pray: Inspire my mind-stream with your blessings,
si lé namgyal dreltsé dönden shying
So that I may conquer saṃsāra, benefit all with whom I am connected,
khorwa dongtruk nüpé pal tob shok
And gain the glorious power to stir saṃsāra from its very depths!

These seven lines of prayer and aspiration were spontaneously written by the old man Dudjom
Dorje at the request of the noble Tsultrim Gyatso.
