Visualisation and Mantra Recitation of the Great Compassionate One
by Dudjom Lingpa

hrih, rangnyi tukjé chenpor gyur
Hrīḥ! I myself transform into the Great Compassionate One,
karsal chak shyi rimshyin du
Brilliant white in color and with four arms—
taljar shel treng pekar nam
Two of which are joined, and two of which hold a crystal rosary and a white lotus.
longkü ché dzok kyiltrung shyuk
In full saṃbhogakāya attire, I sit with my two legs crossed.
tukkar hrih la yik druk kor
At my heart is a syllable hrīḥ encircled by the six syllables.
om mani pemé hung hrih
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ

Recite the mantra one hundred, one thousand or as many times as possible.

At the request of the disciple Rigden, this was spoken by Dudjom Dorje. May it be virtuous!
